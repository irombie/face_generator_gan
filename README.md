# Face Generation Using Generative Adversarial Networks

For this project, we are generating fake faces using the [CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and GANs! 
Due to computational resources, we scaled these images to 32x32. That is why the generated images are not of very high quality but they are still pretty convincing!
